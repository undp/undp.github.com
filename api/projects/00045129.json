However, in common with other temperate grasslands across the globe South Africa's grasslands are critically threatened. 30% of the area has already been irreversibly transformed by anthropogenic activities and only 2.8% is formally conserved in protected areas. These areas are not representative of species and habitat diversity across the biome. Most of the grasslands habitat presently lies in production landscapes allocated to livestock production, agriculture (cereals, some food crops and cash crops such as sugarcane), and afforestation with fast growing exotic tree species. South Africa's largest urban and industrial centre is located within the grasslands, namely the conurbation of Johannesburg and Pretoria, and these environs are a conservation hotspot. Production activities constitute the main threat to grasslands biodiversity. The high turnover of biodiversity across the grasslands landscape and the nature of threats imply that expansion of protected areas alone will not be sufficient to protect this heritage. There is an unmet need, instead, to mainstream biodiversity management into the production practices of the major production sectors providing the stimulus for land use change in the biome, and devise win-win strategies that conserve biodiversity while catering for development.\r\nThe NGBP will complement existing conservation endeavours in the biome by seeking to mainstream conservation objectives into the agriculture, forestry, urban development and coal mining sectors. The programme will lift a number of critical barriers to conservation management, namely, market failure, systemic and institutional capacity weaknesses and management know-how within production sector institutions. These barriers will be addressed through the development of new management tools geared to the needs of specific sectors that protect biodiversity as part of production processes, by internalising the non-pecuniary values of ecosystem services in production, and by strengthening capacity in production sector institutions to address conservation imperatives as part and parcel of economic development. The baseline situation is characterised by many uncoordinated efforts to manage grassland biodiversity. Although the enabling environment for 'mainstreaming' is largely in place, with a supportive policy and legal framework, there is a gap between policy and implementation. This provides an entry point for interventions. The NGBP is designed as a catalytic initiative, which will help coordinate existing conservation efforts and address critical management gaps, such that the effort comes to equal more than the sum of the parts.","output_id":"00053253","output_title":"PIMS 2929 BD FP: Grasslands"}],"project_descr":"National Grasslands Biodiversity Programme (NGBP) PIMS 2929","project_id":"00045129","project_title":"National Grasslands Biodiversity Programme  PIMS 2929","region_id":"RBA","start":"2007-02-06","subnational":[{"awardID":"00045129","lat":"-29","lon":"24","name":"South Africa","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
