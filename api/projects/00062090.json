The activities will produce high impact with relatively low cost and will assist the Ministry of Justice and Public Administration and Judicial Academy in realizing their goals and objectives to advance justice in Serbia. More specifically, the project will support the development of a merit-based career system for judges and prosecutors, strengthen the services provided by the Judicial Academy and further develop a system of mediation. In order to facilitate this, UNDP in Serbia will sustain and expand its contribution to the judicial reform strategy, and CO staff will participate in all relevant judicial reform working groups. All activities are designed to respond to the national social inclusion and poverty reduction goals by applying the human rights based approach.","output_id":"00086951","output_title":"Access to Justice -JA"}],"project_descr":"Policy Advice for Good Governance outcome","project_id":"00062090","project_title":"Good Governance","region_id":"RBEC","start":"2013-06-27","subnational":[]}
