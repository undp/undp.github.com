However, mechanisms to tackle corruption remain rudimentary and poorly enforced as the political, administrative and financial systems are adapting to the rapid deregulation and liberalisation of the market.\r\n\r\nThe development outcome of the project is to improve the ability of the Government of Viet Nam to prevent and combat corruption in compliance with the UN Convention against Corruption (UNCAC)\r\n\r\n The project will be implemented over a 4 year period, with three specific objectives:  \r\n\r\n1.\tTo strengthen national capacities to comply with the international norms and standards provided by UNCAC\r\n2.\tTo strengthen institutional capacities for monitoring and evaluating corruption and anti corruption efforts in compliance with UNCAC\r\n3.\tTo strengthen partnership building and public involvement in the monitoring and evaluation of corruption and anti-corruption efforts in Viet Nam\r\n\r\nThe Government Inspectorate plays a key role both as an implementer and as an advisor of the Government's anti corruption policies; therefore, main beneficiaries of this project are the various departments of GI, as well as other key agencies at the national and local level such as research institutes and more general the wider public.\r\n\r\nThis project presents a complimentary component to and work in tandem with the POSCIS project, in which Sweden, Denmark, Canada, Norway and the Netherlands jointly support GI to strengthen its capacity in a comprehensive manner.","output_id":"00063558","output_title":"Anti-Corruption Convention"}],"project_descr":"Strengthening the capacity of the Government Inspectorate and the Government of Viet Nam to monitor and report on corruption an anti-corruption efforts","project_id":"00051162","project_title":"Anti-Corruption Treaties in VN","region_id":"RBAP","start":"2009-01-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00051162","lat":"21.0245","lon":"105.84117","name":"Ha Noi","precision":"3","type":"PPLC"}]}
