Some studies show that Lebanon may face chronic and critical water shortages by 2020 unless the sector is reformed.  If business as usual continues then the Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW) will in the very near future be unable to meet the needs of the country. Unsustainable water management practices, environmental risks and water governance shortcomings are among the key challenges to be met. Consequently, it is critical for the Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW) to optimize resource use through an integrated approach to water management. \nThe objective of this project is to create a centre at the MEW that will coordinate and promote sustainable water management through both technical and policy-level support.","output_id":"00074096","output_title":"Lebanese water center"}],"project_descr":"Lebanese Centre for Water Conservation and Management (LCWCM)","project_id":"00058662","project_title":"Lebanese Centre for Water Conservation and Management","region_id":"global","start":"2010-05-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00058662","lat":"33.88894","lon":"35.49442","name":"Lebanon","precision":"9","type":"PCL"},{"awardID":"00058662","lat":"33.88894","lon":"35.49442","name":"Lebanon","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
