The first phase of the Project has initiated the consolidation of regional PAR programming and knowledge resources by bringing together two professional networks in a structured manner, so that they may progress towards the development of a broad-based, demand-driven, regional public sector reform programme for the ext five years. It has also made progress in developing an institutional framework for regional cooperation in promoting homegrowv solutions in public service reform. The second phase of the Project focuses on developing and implementing demand-driven regional cooperation activities in four substantive areas (Policy Making and Coordination; Public Finance Management; Public Sector Organization and Staffing; and Public Sector Delivery), deepening and broadening the Network of Focal Points in participating countries, and setting up the RCPAR as a catalyst for inovation and dissemination of best practices to advance Public Administration Reform in the Region.","output_id":"00060545","output_title":"Regional Cooperation on PAR"}],"project_descr":"Strategic programming framework and regional facility for enhanced regional cooperation, professional networking, mutual learning and information sharing on Public Administration Reform in Central and Eastern Europe and the CIS","project_id":"00049576","project_title":"Regional Centre for Public Administration Reform / RCPAR","region_id":"global","start":"2008-02-29","subnational":[{"awardID":"00049576","lat":"48.66667","lon":"19.5","name":"Slovakia","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
