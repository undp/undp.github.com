Multi-hazard and socioeconomic profiling of target areas; 2.) Risk mapping of target areas; and 3.) Vulnerability and Adaptation assessments of target sites. Attainment of Short Term Outcome 2 (STO2), \"Priority climate adaptation and disaster risk mitigation actions developed\", involves formulation of \"no regrets\" risk reduction and climate adaptation measures such as contingency planning and mobilization, Community-based and Managed Early Warning Systems (CBMEWS) ; and, massive information and education campaigns. Short Term Outcome 3 (STO3), \"Climate/Disaster risk management mainstreamed into the target cities'/municipalities' planning and regulatory processes\", will be achieved by enhancing the competencies of local government planners and key partners, especially the academe, to enable them to produce risk-based comprehensive land use and development plans and regulatory processes. Short Term Outcome 4 (STO- 4), \"Socio-economic resilience of the poor and most vulnerable in target areas developed\", is expected to be realized by developing/strengthening the socioeconomic resilience of vulnerable communities through such mechanisms as climate resilient livelihoods and risk sharing/transfer options such as insurance, which will enable them to immediately bounce back when hit by natural disasters. Short Term Outcome 5 (STO-5),\"Local knowledge management (KM) systems established in selected target areas\", involves transformation of process learnings into normative tools and forms that would contribute to the over-all knowledge base on climate change adaptation and disaster risk management in the Philippines","output_id":"00083269","output_title":"Project ReBUILD: Resilience Ca"}],"project_descr":"Project ReBUILD: Resilience Capacity Building for Cities and Municipalities to Reduce Disaster Risks from Climate Change and Natural Hazards, Phase 1","project_id":"00067570","project_title":"Project ReBUILD: Resilience Capacity Building for Cities","region_id":"RBAP","start":"2012-07-01","subnational":[]}
