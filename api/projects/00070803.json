It could serve as a valuable UN offer to the government.  It is characterized as being innovative, fast, nimble and responsive to the needs of the government. The policy facility will operate along two lines: a) provide a menu of well-analysed policy options where the government asks the UN for assistance; and b) it will scan the horizon and pro-actively offer options to the government on emerging and just-over-the-horizon issues. It is intended to work on meta-thematic issues and complements the already prevalent excellent policy advice that individual members of the UNCT provide on particularly sector/thematic/project specific issues. To that end it is envisaged as a sum of the parts that adds up to a bigger whole.","output_id":"00084610","output_title":"Policy and Capacity Developmen"}],"project_descr":" ","project_id":"00070803","project_title":"Policy and Capacity Development Facility","region_id":"RBA","start":"2012-12-03","subnational":[]}
