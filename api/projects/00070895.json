The project will be implemented in Zvanets and Sporovo peatlands in Drogichin and Bereza district in Belarus. Zvanets and Sporovo (Fig.1) are the largest natural fen mires in Europe (single massives of 15,000 and 18,000 ha). With appropriate technologies and equipment, the project will cut shrubs, reeds, and trees at about  3,500 ha during the project life, producing about 2,500 tons of dry biomass. It is expected that the project will result in avoided emissions of 15.6 tCO2-eq/ha/year by replacing fossil fuel use with peatland biomass. Retention (non-deterioration) of fen peatland carbon capacity will amount to 360 tC/ha.","output_id":"00084642","output_title":"Clima-East"}],"project_descr":"Clima-East: Conservation and sustainable management of peatlands in Belarus to minimize carbon emissions and help ecosystems to adapt to climate change, while contributing to the overall mitigation and adaptation effort.","project_id":"00070895","project_title":"Clima-East:Conservation and management of peatlands","region_id":"RBEC","start":"2012-12-05","subnational":[]}
