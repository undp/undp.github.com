A holistic and integrated approach to youth development is being promoted, drawing inspiration from the Songhai Model in Benin. This Model thrives on the interrelationships between environmental resources, agriculture, technology, services and industry. It also explicitly incorporates a human capacity development component, presented as an integrated package of technical, managerial, value-based leadership and entrepreneurial skills development. Operationally, the Model promotes use of local resources, hybridization of traditional and modern agricultural practices, and adaptation of technologies and encourages diversification. Through these practices, Songhai operations integrate the zero waste and total productivity concepts by using biologically and ecologically sound agricultural practices.  Therefore, the Songhai Model creates opportunities for rural communities to participate in the sustainable use and management of their local resources while promoting local economic development","output_id":"00062436","output_title":"Integrated Youth Development P"}],"project_descr":"INTEGRATED YOUTH DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME","project_id":"00050497","project_title":"INTEGRATED YOUTH DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME","region_id":"RBA","start":"2008-01-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00050497","lat":"-14.31882","lon":"35.1322","name":"Nkopola","precision":"3","type":"PPL"}]}
