The design figures of KY WWTP, Phase I, are based on the flow of 26,600 cubic meters per day and load estimates for the year 2018, while the design figures Phase II are based on the flow of 44,900 cubic meters per day and load estimates for the year 2025. \r\nEffluent and emergency pressure pipeline will be constructed to discharge the treated effluent to the infiltration basins or the sea shore in case of emergency situation with a total length of 18.6 km. Through the infiltration basins; the treated effluent will be recharged to the ground water aquifer to enhancing it and to ultimately be used for agricultural purposes.\r\nThe proposed KY WWTP, Phase 1, is envisaged to be constructed and operational in by 2014-2015.","output_id":"00047395","output_title":"Construction of TreatmentPlant"}],"project_descr":"The Construction of  Sewage Treatment Plant and Mian Pressure Line in Khan Younis in the Gaza Strip . \r\nThe project aims at protecting the public health and improving the environmental conditions of Khan Younis residents.","project_id":"00041529","project_title":"Construction of Sewage Treatment Plant in Khan Younis","region_id":"PAPP","start":"2005-01-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00041529","lat":"31.34018","lon":"34.30627","name":"Khan Younis","precision":"3","type":"PPL"}]}
