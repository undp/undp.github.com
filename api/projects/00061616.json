This project will provide global environmental benefits by expanding and/or creating 10 MPAs to increase marine ecosystem representation by up to 32.44% of the total area that was identified in the coastal and marine conservation gap analysis.  This will benefit over 20 coastal and marine ecosystems (coral reefs, seagrasses, mangroves, beaches, coastal lagoons, and estuaries) and habitat for at least nine key marine and coastal species (the humpback whale, the manatee, sharks and five species of sea turtles).  In addition, the management effectiveness of MPAs will increase through:  a) the implementation of participatory management arrangements in three MPAs; b) strengthening inter-institutional cooperation mechanisms; and c) developing a marine ecology monitoring strategy and a CC mitigation and management adaptation strategy for MPAs.","output_id":"00078129","output_title":"PIMS 4259 - Consolidating Cost"}],"project_descr":"PIMS 4259 - Consolidating Costa Rica's Marine Protected Areas (MPAs)","project_id":"00061616","project_title":"PIMS 4259 - Consolidating Costa Rica's Marine Protected","region_id":"RBLAC","start":"2011-09-01","subnational":[]}
