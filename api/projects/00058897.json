Indonesia is one of the main pilot countries for the initial phase. This will be funded by the government of Norway as part of Northwest International Climate and Forest Initiative which was announced during the UNFCCC conference at Bali in 2007.\nThe proposed National Joint Programme (NJP) aims to support The Government of Indonesia (GoI) to timely develop a REDD architecture that will allow a fair, equitable and transparent REDD implementation, and a sustainable contribution of forestry to a reduction of forestry related greenhouse gas emissions.\nMulti stakeholder participation in REDD is of critical importance to REDD readiness. Recognizing the importance to do so, the government has been initially working through the IFCA multi stakeholder alliance. IFCA organized and streamlined stakeholders input. Amongst others, this resulted in an initial outline of what was called a REDD supply chain. Furthermore, subject matter related analysis were conducted which fat into a final consolidation report that has formed the foundation for Indonesia's National REDD Strategy. Recently, the Ministry of Forestry has issued a Ministerial Decrees no. 30/2009 and no. 36/2009, on REDD regulations. The decrees was issued after various in depth multi stakeholder consultations on REDD regulations.\nThe multi stakeholder consultations process also includes people and local communities potentially affected by REDD, UNREDD is keenly aware of the concerned raised by local communities and civil society organization (CSOs) of an emerging REDD scheme in Indonesia. On May 2009, an in depth stakeholder consultation with the indigenous people representatives (hereafter referred to as local community representatives) and CSOs was conducted as part of the development of the UNREDD programme. Inputs from consultations had been used to refine the proposal and will guide later implementation.\nProvincial and district governments are developing policies and have sound interests in developing REDD as an effort to strengthen forest development in their area. While this initiative needs support, better communication between districts, province and central government is essential to make REDD successful in the longer term. Furthermore, particular attention is required to enhance capacity of local government and society in managing forest in the context of the local development planning, including supporting the establishment and capacity building of forest management units. To support the development o9f the national and international REDD architecture, the programme will also assists local governments with preparing and piloting REDD activities on the ground. The result will provide important inputs to the national discussions and decision making processes.\nThe Objective of UNREDD Indonesia programme is \"to support GoI in attaining REDD readiness\". In order to secure this objective, three outcomes with subsequent outputs and activities will be pursued:\nOutcome 1: Strengthened Multistakeholder participations and consensus at national level\nOutput 1.1 (UNDP): Consensus on key issues for national REDD policy development\nOutput 1.2 (UNDP): REDD lesson learned\nOutput 1.3 (UNEP): Communications programme\nOutcome 2: Successful demonstration of establishing of a REL, MRV and fair payment systems best on the national REDD architecture.\nOutput 2.1 (FAO): Improved capacity and methodology design for forest carbon inventory within a Measurement, Reporting and Verification system (MRV), including sub-national pilot implementation.\nOutput 2.2 (FAO): Reference Emissions Level (REL)\nOutput 2.3 (UNDP): Harmonized fair and equitable payment mechanism at provincial level\nOutput 2.4 (UNEP): Toolkit for priority setting towards maximizing potential carbon benefits and incorporating co-benefits, such as bio-diversity conservation and poverty alleviations under MDG.\nOutcome 3: Capacity established to implement REDD at decentralized levels\nOutput 3.1 (UNDP): Capacity for spatial sosio-economic planning incorporating REDD at the district level\nOutput 3.2 (UNDP): Empowered local stakeholders are able to benefit from REDD\nOutput 3.3 (UNDP): Multi stakeholders endorsed district plans for REDD implementation","output_id":"00073846","output_title":"Local actors capacity building"}],"project_descr":"United Nations Collaboartive Programme on Reducing Emission from Deforestation and Forese Degradation (UNREDD) in Indonesia","project_id":"00058897","project_title":"UNREDD in Indonesia","region_id":"RBAP","start":"2010-01-29","subnational":[{"awardID":"00058897","lat":"-7.49944","lon":"110.80611","name":"Central Kalimantan","precision":"4","type":"ADM1"}]}
