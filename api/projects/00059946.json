The project will further strengthen the dialogue, information exchange and cooperation among all the relevant stakeholders including governmental, non-governmental, academic, and private sectors. It is expected that this will result in achieving national consensus on the actions and measures that need to be undertaken to address the climate change related issues relevant for the country on a short and long term. This should be followed by firm commitment for allocation of adequate financial means for realization of the agreed actions and measures.","output_id":"00075206","output_title":"Third Climate Change Report"}],"project_descr":"Third National Report to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change","project_id":"00059946","project_title":"3 Ntl Commun on Climate Change","region_id":"RBEC","start":"2010-05-17","subnational":[{"awardID":"00059946","lat":"41.83333","lon":"22","name":"Macedonia","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
