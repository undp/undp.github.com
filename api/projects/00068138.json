The framework has four outputs focusing on strengthening human rights and transparency through participatory governance mechanisms. First, to support the mandate and organizational structure of the Human Rights Commission, including the establishment of sub-national commissions. Second, to provide long term institutional development of the Human Rights Commission and its outreach capabilities through participatory governance mechanisms. Third, combat corruption through the promotion of accountability, integrity and transparency at all levels of government and civil society. This involves support to the roll-out of the Government of Iraq's National Anti-Corruption Strategy, to strengthen the capacities of key parliamentary committees, to address corruption issues, to enhance engagement of civil society organisations and media in addressing corruption and to provide technical support for the establishment of a new KRG Commission of Integrity and KRG Board of Supreme Audit. Fourth, to utilise civil society organisations to promote participatory and transparent governance which includes financial and technical support to civil society organisations to enhance their engagement with parliament.","output_id":"00083517","output_title":"Enhancing Transparent Particip"},{"award_id":"00068138","budget":[611350.0,601310.0],"crs":"99810","crs_descr":"Sectors Not Specified","donor_id":["11664"],"donor_name":["MDTFO/JP_Iraq_UNDAF_Trust_Fund"],"donor_short":["Iraq_UNDAF"],"expenditure":[288067.0,59517.0],"fiscal_year":["2013","2012"],"focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","gender_descr":"Gender Equality","gender_id":"1","output_descr":null,"output_id":"00083652","output_title":"Participatory Gov& HR"}],"project_descr":"Complementary interventions aim to: support the mandate/structure of the HR Commission and provide develop. & outreach; combat corruption through accountability & transparency & utilise CSOs to promote participatory and transparent governance.","project_id":"00068138","project_title":"Enhancing Transparent Participatory Governance and Human","region_id":"RBAS","start":"2012-02-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00068138","lat":"33","lon":"44","name":"Iraq","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
