The Government, Ministry of Environment (MoE) and key stakeholder groups seeks to maximize this contribution by developing a national strategy for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) and add value to REDD by including conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks. The value added REDD effort is identified as REDD+. As a pre-requisite for REDD+ a number of institutional structures and policies need to be established.
