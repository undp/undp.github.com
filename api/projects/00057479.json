Institutional Capacities will be strengthened through the implementation of Capacity Assessments and Capacity Development responses.  The Unit will provide support to COs and UNCTs when assisting national partners to assess their capacities and develop CD Responses. The Unit will also assist COs and UNCTs in programming CD into UNDAFs and CPAPs.   \r\nBeyond providing Capacity Development services, the Unit will systematize and share knowledge on Capacity Development.  The Unit will work with the Regional Centre's Knowledge Management unit to create Capacity Development knowledge products for the region. UNDP at the Regional level will further collaborate with country offices in providing support to Governments, and in particular their Ministries, Directorates and units which are involved with International Cooperation, ensuring that SSC interventions in the region contain components of capacity development and exit strategies in order to maximize sustainability. This will be further enriched through peer-learning and actively using SSC as a modality to further strengthen these components. UNDP can also benefit from the rich experiences which exist in many countries in the region as the organization supports and helps develop capacity for SSC work in the International Cooperation units and directorates located within Foreign Ministries.","output_id":"00071030","output_title":"Capacity Development & Knowled"},{"award_id":"00057479","budget":[13976.0,25500.0,57240.0,null],"crs":"99810","crs_descr":"Sectors Not Specified","donor_id":["00012"],"donor_name":["Voluntary Contributions"],"donor_short":["UNDP"],"expenditure":[4784.0,35032.0,57230.0,65128.0],"fiscal_year":["2013","2012","2011","2010"],"focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","gender_descr":"Gender Equality","gender_id":"1","output_descr":"(2012) Quality advisory services provided in support of capacity development processes for public institutions and implementing partners\n\n(2009) National Implementation Capacities (NICs), including financial management (FM), procurement, human resource management (HRM) and program / project management remain a challenge in the LAC region. A characteristic of most MICs is that institutional arrangements is the main issue requiring greater capacities in; 1 aligning functions to the changing mandates of agencies; 2 strengthening systems such as HRM or FM; and 3 results-based management; Most of the countries are MICs so ODA is not a significant percentage of the GDP but this means that NICs remain a priority to increase the performance of the countries own budget through efficiencies and greater effectiveness. This has been heightened in the current economic crisis when all countries in the region have seen significant reduction in revenues from taxes as well as reducing revenues from commodities.\nIn addition to central government, decentralization is resulting in an increased need for the NICs need to be addressed in regional, local authorities as well as non state actors. CD LAC has a comparative advantage of being able to engage with key stakeholders in the whole of government or the players in a specific sector, to conduct an assessment to identify and agree the root causes and then develop CD strategies to respond to the priorities. The improved performance in NICs either at a national or sub national level will allow an increase in the performance of service delivery and contribute to MDGs. This generic results area will compliment the interventions planned in the remainder of the project.","output_id":"00071031","output_title":"Capacity Assessment & Nat Impl"}],"project_descr":"Strenghthening national  to reduce inequalities and meet the MDGs in Latin America and the Caribbean","project_id":"00057479","project_title":"Strengthening capacities in LAC","region_id":"global","start":"2009-05-20","subnational":[{"awardID":"00057479","lat":"8.9936","lon":"-79.51973","name":"Panama","precision":"9","type":"PCL"},{"awardID":"00057479","lat":"8.9936","lon":"-79.51973","name":"Panama","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
