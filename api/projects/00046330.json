The Program aims to cover all territories in Mozambique and ART-PAPDEL is in the Cabo Delgado, Nampula, Gaza and Inhambane Provinces. Its main purpose is to operationalize the Action Plan for the Reduction of Absolute Poverty and the attainment of MDGs (PARPA II), which, amongst its goals, it encourages \"rural development as the process of improving living conditions and of pro-rural transformation of the pattern of wealth creation and accumulation in Mozambique\". ART-PAPDEL's strategy foresees the strengthening of technical, human and institutional capacities in LED at the different levels as well as an active and efficient coordination amongst LED actors.  At the local and national level, ART-PAPDEL's expected results are strengthening institutions relevant for LED; including the LED approach into local planning processes; promoting and supporting business initiatives; establishing local coordination mechanisms; establishing knowledge in LED management system as well as drawing up and approving a LED Strategic Plan. At the international level, the programme include participation in/or organisation of events in order to draw together the LED actors in dynamic networks of knowledge in the spirit of South-South, North-South and South-North cooperation.","output_id":"00061417","output_title":"ART PAPDEL Mozambique"}],"project_descr":" ","project_id":"00046330","project_title":"Support to Local Government Effectiveness and Efficiency","region_id":"RBA","start":"2007-01-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00046330","lat":"-18.25","lon":"35","name":"Mozambique","precision":"9","type":"PCL"},{"awardID":"00046330","lat":"-15.11646","lon":"39.2666","name":"Nampula","precision":"3","type":"PPLA"},{"awardID":"00046330","lat":"-12.5","lon":"39.4","name":"Cabo Delgado","precision":"3","type":"ADM1"},{"awardID":"00046330","lat":"-25.05194","lon":"33.64417","name":"Gaza","precision":"3","type":"PPLA"},{"awardID":"00046330","lat":"-23.03229","lon":"35.26166","name":"Massinga","precision":"3","type":"ADM2"},{"awardID":"00046330","lat":"-14.18111","lon":"40.52583","name":"Memba","precision":"3","type":"PPL"},{"awardID":"00046330","lat":"-15.03417","lon":"40.73583","name":"Ilha","precision":"3","type":"PPL"},{"awardID":"00046330","lat":"-23.865","lon":"35.38333","name":"Inhambane","precision":"3","type":"PPLA"}]}
