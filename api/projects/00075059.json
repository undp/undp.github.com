The objective of the project is to support the strategic positioning of DPMM by strengthening the engagement of stakeholders, institutionalizing procedures and strengthening the incentive and accountability mechanisms for greater adoption of good practices.  This will help in advocating for the utilization of the Integrated National Development Information System (INDIS), which is a database providing information on financial & physical progress and results of development projects and programmes, and ensuring its wide use in Government.
