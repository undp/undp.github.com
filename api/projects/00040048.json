In this urban area 99 malaria cases were reported in 2011. Although a significant reduction in malaria cases has been achieved over the recent years, risk of re-introduction of malaria transmission and occurring malaria outbreaks is high due to cross border population movement with Pakistan border and high level of vectorial capacity.  \r\nTotal number of 3,768 water reservoirs was identified as breeding places for mosquitoes in the locality.  Controlling malaria in urban setting is very difficult and costly by routine controlling measures, therefore finding an innovative and cost-effective method is a priority of the health system.  In keeping with the submitted R10 malaria proposal to the Global Fund (section 5.4.4), and the ongoing malaria project, it is of high priority to establish the best cost-effective vector control modality to eliminate malaria in urban setting, which is also aligned with National Strategic Plan for Malaria Elimination.  Given that Chabahar is the main industrial and trade zone in south east of the country and malaria has been considered as a barrier against development in this area, contributing to the efforts toward malaria elimination in this area is considered a high priority. \r\nFurther to note is that the main objective of the Global Fund is elimination of falciparum malaria and Chabahar has a high potential for reintroduction of transmission of this type of malaria hence is a threat to the project success. This priority has been discussed and agreed upon between the officials of UNDP and Center for Disease Control (CDC), MoHME.  \r\nThe main activity of the Sub-Project is to cover the water reservoirs in Chabahar, Sistan and Baloochestan in two stages, pilot study (839 water reservoirs  that is the subject of this project) and intervention (2929 water reservoirs).  Total estimated budget for UNDP's contribution in the stage of pilot study, in which 839 water reservoirs is planned to be covered is 100,000 USD.  The Sub-Project is closely linked to the larger Global Fund project in the sense that the latter project presumes the sound implementation of the Sub-Project as a given.","output_id":"00086420","output_title":"Sust.
