National Technology Action Plans (TAPs) agreed by all stakeholders at the country level will be prepared consistent with both the domestic and global objectives.   Each TAP, which will outline essential elements of an enabling framework for technology transfer consisting of market development, institutional, regulatory and financial measures, and human and institutional capacity development requirements, will also include a detailed plan of action to implement the proposed policy measures and estimate the need for external assistance to cover additional implementation costs.  Targeted training and supporting materials related to methodology for prioritization of technologies, market assessment, access and links to data on technologies will be developed and tested and made available to all participant countries.","output_id":"00078921","output_title":"Technology Needs Assessment"}],"project_descr":"Enabling Activities for the Preparation of Lebanon's Third National Communication (TNC) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).","project_id":"00061088","project_title":"Preparation to theThird National Communication to UNFCCC","region_id":"global","start":"2011-06-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00061088","lat":"33.88894","lon":"35.49442","name":"Lebanon","precision":"9","type":"PCL"},{"awardID":"00061088","lat":"33.88894","lon":"35.49442","name":"Lebanon","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
