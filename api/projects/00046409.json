The plan proposes to replace present CFC-based technology with HCFC-141b and water-based technologies.  The plan includes one individual project, based on size and application and two group projects for smaller enterprises based on application.  The projects non-investment costs for management, awareness and monitoring and investment costs for equipment replacement and retrofit, technical assistance, trials, incremental operating costs and contingencies.  The grant requested is based on maximum allowable costs with threshold limitations applied.  The approved costs include flexibility in application to allow for efficient phaseout within the sector.  Any (unlikely) CFC users in this sector that will be identified at a later stage will be subject to Chile's ODS phaseout regulations that stipulate phaseout not later than December 31, 2009.  \r\nThe Government will not seek any funding for the foam sector beyond this request.","output_id":"00055266","output_title":"Marco Terminal sector espumas"}],"project_descr":"Proyecto Marco Terminal para la eliminaci\u00f3n total del uso de CFC-11 en la fabricaci\u00f3n de espuma de poliuretano en Chile","project_id":"00046409","project_title":"Marco Terminal sector espumas","region_id":"RBLAC","start":"2007-02-08","subnational":[{"awardID":"00046409","lat":"-30","lon":"-71","name":"Chile","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
