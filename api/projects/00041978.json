This confirmed that the NHRC would require a 5 year programme of capacity building to establish it as an effective, efficient and credible organisation capable of ensuring promotion and protection of human rights in Bangladesh, particularly of the most vulnerable groups. \nThe project focuses on capacity development of personnel, but also addresses a number of structural and infrastructural issues, as identified by the needs assessment. It proposes a range of capacity development interventions, aimed at improving the NHRC's performance over the medium to long term in relation to investigations, monitoring, complaints, research, public education and advocacy of human rights. These include: the provision of experienced NHRI practitioners from the region as well as local human rights expertise to provide advice to Commissioners and staff to set up appropriate and effective institutional frameworks and to undertake in-country training; fellowships; peer exchanges with, and work placements, in NHRIs in the region and human rights organisations nationally. It also includes development of the Commission's organisational structure, human resource strategy, preparation of complaints procedures and case management system. Funding for new infrastructure and implementing some programmes which are likely to be beyond the NHRC's state-financed resources are also provided for.","output_id":"00074666","output_title":"Human Rights Commission"},{"award_id":"00041978","budget":[1145400.0,756000.0],"crs":"15130","crs_descr":"Legal and judicial development","donor_id":["00012"],"donor_name":["Voluntary Contributions"],"donor_short":["UNDP"],"expenditure":[474625.0,671471.0],"fiscal_year":["2013","2012"],"focus_area":"2","focus_area_descr":"Democratic governance","gender_descr":"Gender Equality","gender_id":"1","output_descr":"Strengthening the formal justice system and the rule of law is a priority for the Government of Bangladesh and the Supreme Court. There is increasing demand for improvements in the administration of timely affordable, timely and equitable justice. One of the key constraints facing the judiciary is the large case backlog of around 1.8 million cases. The backlog is placing considerable pressure on the court system and is hampering access to justice. It is also symptomatic of a number of other issues, including complex procedures and a lack of effective case management. The Supreme Court has requested UNDP to support the Judiciary to strengthen its capacity to administer the court system and reduce the case backlogs. A reduction would provide a sustainable foundation to improve access to justice to the public, especially, vulnerable groups such as the poor, women and children.  \r\nThe project, known as JUST (Judicial Strengthening), will focus on four outputs:\r\n1.\tImproved case management in the Supreme Court;\r\n2.\tImproved strategic planning and administrative capacity of the Supreme Court; \r\n3.\t3 district courts deliver improved services for court users; and\r\n4.\tStrengthened training capacity on case-management.","output_id":"00081908","output_title":"Judicial Strengthening"},{"award_id":"00041978","budget":[1686250.0,313750.0],"crs":"15130","crs_descr":"Legal and judicial development","donor_id":["00012","00551"],"donor_name":["Voluntary Contributions","DEPARTMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT"],"donor_short":["UNDP","DFID"],"expenditure":[583366.0,50282.0],"fiscal_year":["2013","2012"],"focus_area":"2","focus_area_descr":"Democratic governance","gender_descr":"Gender Equality","gender_id":"1","output_descr":"Strengthening the formal justice system and the rule of law is a priority for the Government of Bangladesh. There is increasing demand for improvements in the administration of timely, affordable, and accessible justice. One of the key constraints facing the justice sector is the slow disposal rate and corresponding build-up of a large case backlog. The backlog is placing considerable pressure on the sector and is hampering access to justice. It is also symptomatic of a number of other issues, including complex procedures and a lack of effective case management between agencies. UNDP, through the experience generated from the Justice Sector Strategic Development project, has facilitated a process that has shown appreciation of the benefits of moving towards a more coordinated approach between justice sector institutions. Building on these positive results a new project establishing a Justice Sector Facility will work across the sector to strengthen institutional planning capacities across the sector as well as support two district pilots to improve the administration of criminal justice between agencies. The project will focus on three outputs:\r\n1.\tCommunication, coordination and co-operation between justice agencies enhanced in two district pilots through establishment of solutions for inter-agency case management; \r\n2.\tSelected agencies have improved strategic planning, monitoring and evaluation, delivery of government legal aid, and prosecution of cases; and\r\n3.\tStrengthened cross sectoral dialogue and sector wide coordination mechanism established.","output_id":"00083546","output_title":"Justice Sector Facility"}],"project_descr":"Promoting Access to Justice & Human Rights in Bangladesh","project_id":"00041978","project_title":"Promoting Access to Justice & Human Rights in Bangladesh","region_id":"RBAP","start":"2007-07-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00041978","lat":"23.7104","lon":"90.40744","name":"Dhaka","precision":"3","type":"PPLC"},{"awardID":"00041978","lat":"25.96667","lon":"88.95","name":"Nilphamari District","precision":"3","type":"ADM2"},{"awardID":"00041978","lat":"26","lon":"89.25","name":"Lalmonirhat District","precision":"3","type":"ADM2"},{"awardID":"00041978","lat":"25.6","lon":"89.25","name":"Rangpur District","precision":"3","type":"ADM2"},{"awardID":"00041978","lat":"24.91667","lon":"91.76667","name":"Sylhet District","precision":"3","type":"ADM2"},{"awardID":"00041978","lat":"24.4191069","lon":"91.7538817","name":"Maulvibazar District","precision":"3","type":"ADM2"},{"awardID":"00041978","lat":"23.66667","lon":"89.55","name":"Rajbari District","precision":"3","type":"ADM2"},{"awardID":"00041978","lat":"23.63333","lon":"88.85","name":"Chuadanga District","precision":"3","type":"ADM2"},{"awardID":"00041978","lat":"23.41667","lon":"90.16667","name":"Faridpur District","precision":"3","type":"ADM2"},{"awardID":"00041978","lat":"23.43333","lon":"89.43333","name":"Magura District","precision":"3","type":"ADM2"},{"awardID":"00041978","lat":"23.13333","lon":"89.6","name":"Narail District","precision":"3","type":"ADM2"},{"awardID":"00041978","lat":"24.43944","lon":"90.78291","name":"Kishoreganj District","precision":"3","type":"ADM2"},{"awardID":"00041978","lat":"23.16667","lon":"89.91667","name":"Gopalganj District","precision":"3","type":"ADM2"},{"awardID":"00041978","lat":"21.94063","lon":"89.78011","name":"Pirojpur District","precision":"3","type":"ADM2"},{"awardID":"00041978","lat":"22.13333","lon":"90.13333","name":"Barguna District","precision":"3","type":"ADM2"},{"awardID":"00041978","lat":"22.33333","lon":"90.33333","name":"Patuakhali District","precision":"3","type":"ADM2"},{"awardID":"00041978","lat":"22.3384","lon":"91.83168","name":"Chittagong District","precision":"3","type":"ADM2"},{"awardID":"00041978","lat":"21.45388","lon":"91.96765","name":"Coxs Bazar","precision":"3","type":"PPL"},{"awardID":"00041978","lat":"23.7104","lon":"90.40744","name":"National Human Rights Commission, Dhaka","precision":"1","type":"PPLC"}]}
