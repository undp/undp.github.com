This initiative aims to support Small Island Developing States (SIDS) to transition to low carbon economies through development and deployment of renewable energy (RE) resources and promotion of greater energy efficiency (EE). \nIn the Pacific region, it was decided that on the part of UNDP, the project concepts that were proposed by the Pacific Island Countries (PICs) will comprise a regional project that whose objective is to promote low carbon development for Pacific SIDs through the deployment of renewable energy resources and promotion of enhanced energy efficiency.  This project will be implemented as part of the ongoing Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP)-UNDP- Global Environment Facility (GEF) regional project PIGGAREP (Pacific Islands Greenhouse Gas Abatement through Renewable Energy Project). The selected project concepts will collectively form part of what will be called as the PIGGAREP \"Plus\". In October 2011, a number of PICs submitted 11 project concepts for inclusion in said project.\nAs agreed by the PICs, the top 4 ranked project concepts will be considered first during the first phase of the SIDS DOCK Program:\n\u2022\tSolomon Islands: Solar PV-Powered Rural Telecommunication Systems\n\u2022\tTonga: Solar PV-Powered Well Water Pumping Systems in Haapai Islands\n\u2022\tTuvalu: Energy Efficiency Demonstration House\n\u2022\tNorth Pacific Region: Sustaining Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Measures in Micronesia (SREEM)  comprised of PIGGAREP+ sub-components in FSM, RMI and Palau.","output_id":"00087102","output_title":"Greenhouse Gas Abatement PLUS"}],"project_descr":"Pacific Islands Greenhouse Gas Abatement through Renewable Energy Project (PIGGAREP/+)","project_id":"00044633","project_title":"Pacific Islands Greenhouse Gas Abatement - PIGGAREP/+","region_id":"RBAP","start":"2006-10-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00044633","lat":"-13.8031","lon":"-172.17831","name":"Samoa","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
