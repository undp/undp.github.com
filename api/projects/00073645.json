Through pursuing this goal, the project aims to shape and catalyse a new phase of sustained international, regional and domestic support for peacebuilding and good governance in the Sahel. The project is structured around two intended outcomes, respectively focused on the state and civil society. These outcomes will provide the parameters within which UNDP Country Offices in the five Sahel countries covered by the project may use the funding from this project to build on priority initiatives for peacebuilding and good governance within each country. The project is to be implemented over one year, using the project delivery and management structures of UNDP's Country Offices, its Regional Center in Dakar, and its Regional Bureau for Africa.","output_id":"00086384","output_title":"Output 6: Regional Component"}],"project_descr":" ","project_id":"00073645","project_title":"Peace Consolidation and Governance in Sahel","region_id":"global","start":"2013-05-15","subnational":[]}
