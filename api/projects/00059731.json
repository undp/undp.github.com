For this there is a clear need to have a directly implemented project within the Country Office to support the efficient implementation of the CPAP 2010-2015 and ensure successful delivery of outcomes. UNDP assistance will offer a continuum of strategic programmatic support in the same substantive areas as its predecessor country programme (2005-09), namely: i) economic governance and poverty reduction; ii) environment and energy, and; iii) democratic governance.
