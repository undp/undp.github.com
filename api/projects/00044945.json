This project will also help the National Police Training Academy fill some of the funding gaps that are critical to the sustenance and viability of the institution. Some of the funding will also be used for the equipping and strengthening of 10 police stations headquarters, with Women and Child Protection (WACP) units.","output_id":"00052996","output_title":"Restructuring and training of"}],"project_descr":"Support to restruction the Liberia National Police and renovation and construction of major faciliities","project_id":"00044945","project_title":"Restructuring and training of the Liberian National Poli","region_id":"RBA","start":"2006-08-28","subnational":[{"awardID":"00044945","lat":"6.5","lon":"-9.5","name":"Liberia","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
