Component 1 will be implemented by REC in Albania, F.Y.R. of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia while Component 2 will be implemented by UNDP Kosovo in Kosovo. Both project components aim to to support low emission development in the target countries.\r\nComponent 1 aims at (I) providing assessment and options in the low emission development transformation of four countries in the electricity sector and (II) providing policy options in building energy efficiency increase for the region with replicable methodology. The time-horizon for the scenarios is 2025/2030 and the studies will identify potential nationally appropriate mitigation measures (NAMAs ). Local stakeholders and experts will be involved in the development of the scenarios and the results of the work will be introduced at workshops in the target countries as well in Brussels to the donor community.\r\nThe main purpose of the Component 2 is to support the Government of Kosovo to mainstream climate change concerns into sectoral and overall Kosovo's development priorities, thus enabling Kosovo to deal with climate change-related issues, and consider it not only as a separate environmental issue but as an issue of sustainable development. It will increase the capacity for low emission climate resilient development strengthened at national and local level; enable development of low emission climate resilient strategy and promote sustainable energy policies and programs and enhance public awareness concerning energy efficiency.\r\nGovernmental organisations, relevant civil society organisations as well as private sector actors will be the target groups of both component of the project, which will bring benefit for the society of the target countries in general.","output_id":"00087252","output_title":"Support for Low Emission Devel"}],"project_descr":" ","project_id":"00075228","project_title":"Support for Low Emission Development in Kosovo","region_id":"RBEC","start":"2013-08-01","subnational":[]}
