The RRMC model stresses the need to equip and build capacity at a local level in order to carry out local assessments of risk, produce hazard and risk maps, and compile information from different actors in a territory in order that decision-makers can make informed decisions in a potentially hazardous situation. RRMCs also form a focus point for managing and communicating socio-economic information on losses after an event such as derived from initial damage assessments, thus integrating the early recovery element.  Since these centres manage information on disaster risk reduction including vulnerability, they will also be well positioned to ensure that climate adaptation measures are incorporated into local programmes and projects.  In addition, they provide a vehicle for strengthening a gender-perspective in risk reduction analysis, ensuring its visibility in risk studies and assessments, as well as the collection of sex-disaggregated data. The revision better draws together the various elements in effective risk management, calls for a more realistic roll-out period for this pilot, provides the necessary training and technical support for pilot countries and aims to consolidate lesson learned,  allowing for further potential replication in the future. The revision also highlights the need for a sustainable approach from the beginning, allowing national level partners to assume responsibilities for the pilot and using regional-level resources as an initial leverage tool. Output 1 is reduced from two (2) indicators to one (1); the indicative activities reflect the logic of the replication process, resources available, technical support and ownership/sustainability.","output_id":"00076586","output_title":"Capacity Development: DRR & Ad"},{"award_id":"00060722","budget":[100267.0,228000.0,48150.0],"crs":"99810","crs_descr":"Sectors Not Specified","donor_id":["00012"],"donor_name":["Voluntary Contributions"],"donor_short":["UNDP"],"expenditure":[61584.0,79952.0,null],"fiscal_year":["2013","2012","2011"],"focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","gender_descr":"Gender Equality","gender_id":"1","output_descr":"Improved knowledge management on CCA and DRR:  This output is more clearly formulated around four indicators, which include integration of CCA & DRR, planning for recovery and seismic risk as emergent themes, gender and sharing of best practices between and across regions.
