Open.undp.org presents UNDP’s 6,000+ development projects and 8,000 outputs in 177 countries and territories worldwide. It represents UNDP’s commitment to publish comprehensive, quality and timely information about aid flows and results. Open.undp.org is a component of our implementation of the [International Aid Transparency Initiative](http://www.aidtransparency.net/) (IATI) to which UNDP is a signatory. IATI is a voluntary multi-stakeholder initiative aimed at making information about aid spending easier to access, understand and use.

Open.undp.org enables users to find project information categorized broadly by location, funding source, and focus areas, and drill down for comprehensive project data, including budget, expenditure, completion status, implementing organization, contribution to gender equality, project documents, and more.  Open.undp.org features current project site images and is integrated with UNDP country office external web sites to enhance knowledge sharing.

###Working in the open: contributing to better development cooperation and results

By making comprehensive up-to-date information about more than 6,000 projects available to the public, UNDP is contributing to improving the effectiveness and value of development cooperation by increasing:

__Accountability:__ Advocacy groups, academics, journalists, civil society organizations, development practitioners, and beneficiaries are now able to better track how development cooperation is being used for and the results it is achieving. 

__Efficiency:__ Improved access to data helps policymakers, bilateral agencies, and multilateral organizations manage development finance more effectively and efficiently to achieve greater impact on sustainable human development. 

__Trust:__ Accountability, performance effectiveness, and transparency are for creating development partnerships that are based on trust.

UNDP is interested in hearing users’ [ideas and comments](#about/contactinfo) about open.undp.org.
