Since 2002, and with substantial support and technical assistance from the international community, the CEC has successfully carried out voter registration activities, presidential and legislative elections, in addition to several civic education projects. In moving toward a more self-sustainable and cost-effective CEC, this initiative uses the electoral cycle approach to begin to address the long-term professional development and civic engagement needs of the CEC.  The professional development component will focus on designing and implementing a long-term institution building programme for the CEC and its staff, based on a baseline study. The civic engagement component will focus on systematizing and implementing a comprehensive and targeted programme of engagement with electoral stakeholders that recognizes and meets the needs of the Palestinian community. The current project will be a seed initiative that seeks to begin the professional development of the CEC and promote inclusive participation in electoral and political processes, while designing an overall umbrella programme that would include support to more institutions and processes over time.","output_id":"00076401","output_title":"Support to Central Elections"},{"award_id":"00060621","budget":[1075741.0,1010953.0,400152.0],"crs":"15130","crs_descr":"Legal and judicial development","donor_id":["00012","10159"],"donor_name":["Voluntary Contributions","EUROPEAN COMMISSION"],"donor_short":["UNDP","EUCOMM"],"expenditure":[652702.0,876208.0,55599.0],"fiscal_year":["2013","2012","2011"],"focus_area":"2","focus_area_descr":"Democratic governance","gender_descr":"Gender Equality","gender_id":"1","output_descr":"The overall objective is to strengthen the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) Secretariat to support the PLC as the democratically elected legislative body within the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).

The fall of the different regimes in the Arab region has proven that population's inclusive participation in decision making processes through inclusive and effective democratic institutions to be essential, even when economic development seems to be strong but unfortunately not shared with the (entire) population. \nThere is clearly a need for more inclusiveness in the work of parliaments and political parties as democratic institutions, a need to strengthen the representativeness of the assemblies as well as a necessity to rebuild citizens' trust in state institutions and their ability to improve citizens' lives.   Engaging with parliaments and political parties on a neutral manner will help foster inclusive political and economic participation and rebuild resilient state-society relations and prevent conflict. This project is seen as a new approach to UNDP's work on political process reform through an integrated approach to support to parliaments and political parties in select Arab States through joint support from BDP / DGG parliamentary development team and the BCPR crisis & governance team. . The outputs will meet important milestones for parliaments and political parties that have the structure, legal framework and capacity to engage all citizens in the political process and are able to be positive actors in preventing conflict.","output_id":"00083276","output_title":"Inclusive and Participative Po"}],"project_descr":"Support to the Central Elections Commissions over Electoral Cycle","project_id":"00060621","project_title":"Support to the Electoral Cycle","region_id":"PAPP","start":"2010-09-29","subnational":[{"awardID":"00060621","lat":"31.92157","lon":"35.20329","name":"Palestine","precision":"9","type":"PCL"},{"awardID":"00060621","lat":"32.22111","lon":"35.25444","name":"West Bank","precision":"4","type":"ADM1"},{"awardID":"00060621","lat":"31.5","lon":"34.46667","name":"Gaza Strip","precision":"4","type":"ADM1"}]}
