EEG will do so by first consolidating, coordinating, and promoting UNDP's policy positions on climate change which, in turn, will strengthen its own ability to provide support to countries. Targeted outreach materials and publications as well as projects aimed at enhancing the strategic positioning of UNDP on the linkages between development and climate change are essential. Increased support and capacity development for COs is also key to reaching the outcome.
