The proposed modality is the support to the creation of new value-added chains, and the strengthening of those that are currently operating in agriculture and related food processing industries, and in particular: fruit production, vegetables production and dairy processing. \r\nThe project supports key BiH agencies to support SMEs in meeting international standards and accessing new markets (State Veterinary Office, Food Safety Agency, Institute for Standardization, Export Promotion Agency).  Parallely, support is also provided to select SMEs to increase their:\r\n\u2022\tcompetitiveness on  domestic and export markets, \r\n\u2022\tproduction and \r\n\u2022\temployment\r\n\r\nFurthermore, value chain provides a mechanism through which micro-producers (those that supply the SMEs; e.g. individual farmers) may participate in the gains from economic growth, and take a first, important step towards full inclusion in the formal economy. Through the symbiotic relationship between SMEs and micro-producers, incomes and employment will be increased, and poverty will be reduced.","output_id":"00070578","output_title":"Value Chains for Employment"}],"project_descr":"Value Chains for Employment strengthened and livelihoods improved","project_id":"00057201","project_title":"Value Chains for Employment","region_id":"RBEC","start":"2009-06-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00057201","lat":"44.15","lon":"17.5","name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
