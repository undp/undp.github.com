The GPECS funds will focus on two specific areas  building the initial capacity of the soon-to-be-created Independent Electoral Commission, and also systemising the interaction between the IEC and stakeholders of the electoral process and candidates. The support will serve primarily as a start-up of a larger, multi-year project currently in the preliminary design phase. The objective of the intervention is to allow the IEC and stakeholders reach a preparedness level for them to play their role in the elections and also assist the implementation of electoral support projects being currently designed by many international partners. The expected outputs are twofold: 1) for the IEC, it will have the necessary regulations in place to operate in a professional manner; 2) for stakeholders, they will have established clear lines of communication with the IEC, they will have been made aware and act to promote the participation of women as officials and candidates for elections. In addition, women's active engagement will be facilitated within the IEC's structures.","output_id":"00081741","output_title":"Strengthening Electoral Proces"}],"project_descr":"Strengthening the Electoral Processes in Jordan","project_id":"00065103","project_title":"Strengthening Electoral Processes in Jordan","region_id":"RBAS","start":"2012-03-01","subnational":[]}
