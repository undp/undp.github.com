Youth participation in development is perceived to sustain the national development results while ensuring that such development is inclusive and participatory in a meaningful way. The project is envisaged to compliment recent public-sector efforts, which are mainly UNDP-supported, to strategically approach issues of youth participation in development. The project embraces three key outputs: 1) Warif's institutional capacity developed to deliver the organization's mandate on volunteerism with particular emphasis on youth volunteerism; 2) volunteerism niches explored, identified and verified in a national forum to reach a wide-ranging consensus; and 3) outreach prototype program developed.","output_id":"00082101","output_title":"Capacity Development for Warif"}],"project_descr":" ","project_id":"00065733","project_title":"Capacity Development for Warif to Promote Volunteerism","region_id":"RBAS","start":"2012-06-01","subnational":[]}
