The project aims to empower and fully mobilize all communities in both municipalities to support the most vulnerable among Roma, Ashkali, Egyptians, Albanian and Serb communities, as well as IDPs and other groups who experience multiple dimensions of human insecurity and are at risk of social exclusion. The objective of this intervention is to decrease the vulnerability and human security risks that these communities face. \r\nThe project focuses on multiple critical human security challenges (economic, health, environmental, and community security) by using three main interventions:\r\n(i) Stimulating livelihood opportunities for those least able to participate in the labour market (with a focus on those most at risk of labour market exclusion among vulnerable groups, such as RAE, youth and women), by promoting work-readiness, learning skills and improved social protection;\r\n(ii) Improving the health prospects of those most at risk from environmental and lifestyle hazards in two of Kosovo's most polluted and poorest municipalities; (iii) Providing immediate benefits to communities (such as support to livelihood generation) which will be balanced with longer-term preventative measures in health, education and participatory decision making to ensure sustainability through capacity-development, partnership, and ownership","output_id":"00083862","output_title":"Building a Better Future"}],"project_descr":"Building a better future for citizens of Fush\u00ebKosov\u00eb/Kosovo Polje and Obiliq/Obilic: Participation, Protection, and multi-ethnic Partnerships for improved education, health and sustainable livelihoods","project_id":"00069078","project_title":"Building better future for citizens of 2 Municipalities","region_id":"RBEC","start":"2012-09-01","subnational":[]}
