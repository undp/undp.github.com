Specifically, the project will work in pilot locations in Almaty and East Kazakhstan oblast, where it will demonstrate community-based DRR and build the case for further DRR mainstreaming regionally and nationally. The project will link the initiatives of local communities to those of national disaster management authorities, allowing the national authorities to realize the strengths of local communities in DRR, and to further integrate local-level risk management into long-term governance and environmental initiatives. The project is implemented by the Ministry of Emergency Situations in close partnership with UNDP and the Kazakhstan Red Crescent Society.","output_id":"00082827","output_title":"Community-Based Disaster Risk"}],"project_descr":"DIPECHO VII: Community-Based Disaster Risk Reduction in South-East Kazakhstan","project_id":"00066780","project_title":"Community-Based Disaster Risk Reduction","region_id":"RBEC","start":"2012-05-01","subnational":[]}
