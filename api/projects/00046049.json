Develop standardized, generic specifications, formats and contracts, which may be used in Bosnia and Herzegovina, including performance contracting. Make available a pool of technical, social and legislative experts to support investment developments and support the transaction process. In addition, it is intended that this pool of experts will provide a technical review and coaching of local experts contracted under other outcomes on the basis of need. The business model used for delivery of biomass energy systems implemented during this project will be further refined through an analytical evaluation. The successes will be captured in a detailed case study, which will form the basis of work to replicate the business model in other regions of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The proposed project will enhance local experience and awareness of biomass energy providing a firm foundation for these issues to be addressed in the context of larger initiatives to address energy, forest and business policies and legislation.","output_id":"00054633","output_title":"Biomass Energy for Employment"}],"project_descr":"Bosnia and Herzegovina Biomass Energy for Employment and Energy Security Project","project_id":"00046049","project_title":"Biomass Energy for Employment","region_id":"RBEC","start":"2009-10-21","subnational":[{"awardID":"00046049","lat":"44.114","lon":"19.1951","name":"Bratunac","precision":"3","type":"PPL"},{"awardID":"00046049","lat":"42.5055","lon":"18.1837","name":"Milici","precision":"3","type":"PPL"},{"awardID":"00046049","lat":"44.626","lon":"19.1748","name":"Srebrenica","precision":"3","type":"PPL"}]}
