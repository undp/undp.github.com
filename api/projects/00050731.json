These buildings are now in obsolete condition and do not provide for minimum hygienic and comfort living conditions. Energy use per square meter is almost 3-5 times as those in European Union and varies between 320 and 690 kWh/m2 per year. The project aims at reducing energy consumption and associated GHG emissions in Kyrgyzstan building sector by 30-40% as compared to the current level by:\r\n(1) adopting and enforcing mandatory building energy performance codes, standards and labels (the Energy Pass) in line with internationally recognized best-practices;\r\n(2) demonstrating feasibility and viability of an integrated design approach for energy efficiency in public buildings;\r\n(3) building capacity of building and construction professionals to implement new building regulation; and \r\n(4) establishing a system to monitor energy consumption and CO2 emissions in Kyrgyzstan building sector.","output_id":"00062794","output_title":"ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN BUILDINGS"}],"project_descr":"Improving Energy Efficiency in Buildings","project_id":"00050731","project_title":"IMPROVING ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN BUILDINGS","region_id":"RBEC","start":"2008-08-26","subnational":[]}
