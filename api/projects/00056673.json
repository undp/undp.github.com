The case for decentralization rests in part on the effective canonization of the economy arising from designation of land categories and travel limitations. Support to economic decentralization will be delivered as one element of UNDP's Local Government Support Programme, which has the objective of decentralized, efficient and inclusive local government in the oPt capable of delivering quality services. The approach to developing an economic role for local government units will initially be through experimentation, focusing on 'pilot' municipalities as a basis for models. Funding will also be provided to support assumption of these responsibilities and directly for actions in economic development.","output_id":"00074700","output_title":"Support to LED in the oPt"},{"award_id":"00056673","budget":[100395.0],"crs":"15140","crs_descr":"Government administration","donor_id":[""],"donor_name":["UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME"],"donor_short":[],"expenditure":[30725.0],"fiscal_year":["2011"],"focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","gender_descr":"None","gender_id":"0","output_descr":"This project is part of  the  UNDP/PAPP  Local Governance Support Programme (LGSP 2010-2013) that aims to contribute to the development of a democratic, decentralized, transparent, and inclusive local governance system in the occupied Palestinian territory .
