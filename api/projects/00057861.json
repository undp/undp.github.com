Drought and floods have been pointed out as the most frequent hazards, but they are not the only ones. Fire, landslides, environmental degradation, HIV/AIDS, disease epidemics, conflict and more are also hazards in Kenya that bring disasters. Although a disaster risk management structure exists in Kenya, much of the current structure is ad hoc. National policies and plans are not in place and lack of resources remain a constant challenge. There is a strong need for an efficient and effective insitutional and legal framework for disaster risk management in the country.","output_id":"00071619","output_title":"3KEN09303: Disaster Risk Mgt"},{"award_id":"00057861","budget":[0.0,76000.0,44000.0],"crs":"73010","crs_descr":"Reconstruction relief and rehabilitation","donor_id":["00012"],"donor_name":["Voluntary Contributions"],"donor_short":["UNDP"],"expenditure":[3394.0,77325.0,36785.0],"fiscal_year":["2013","2012","2011"],"focus_area":"3","focus_area_descr":"Crisis prevention & recovery","gender_descr":"Gender Equality","gender_id":"1","output_descr":"Kenya risks losing gains made on key millennium development goals such as access to education and a reduction in child mortality due to severe drought conditions.
