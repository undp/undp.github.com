It will attempt to achieve this outcome by: a.) assessing the GMMA's vulnerabilities to disaster and climate change risks; b.) developing and implementing priority disaster/climate risk mitigation actions for GMMA such as formulation and testing of an integrated contingency plan and establishment of early warning systems; 3.) enhancing the competencies of GMMA LGUs and critical partners to mainstream DRM/CRM into local planning and regulatory processes;4.) demonstrating the mainstreaming of DRM/CRM into local land use/development plan(s) and regulatory processes of Metro Manila and selected GMMA LGUs; and 5.) establishing a knowledge management system, including a vigorous Community of Practice, on Disaster/Climate Risk Management. The project is envisioned to achieve all the results over a period of three (3) years and expected to improve mechanisms and protocols on DRM/CRM. The project covers Metro Manila and the provinces of Rizal and Bulacan.","output_id":"00077129","output_title":"Enhancing Greater Metro Manila"}],"project_descr":"Enhancing Greater Metro Manila's (GMMA)Institutional Capacities for Effective Disaster/Climate  Risk Management towards Sustainable Development","project_id":"00061036","project_title":"Enhancing Greater Metro Manila's (GMMA)Institutional Cap","region_id":"RBAP","start":"2011-05-03","subnational":[{"awardID":"00061036","lat":"14.6042","lon":"120.9822","name":"Greater Metro Manila","precision":"4","type":"PPLC"},{"awardID":"00061036","lat":"14.58639","lon":"121.17528","name":"Rizal","precision":"4","type":"PPL"},{"awardID":"00061036","lat":"14.79278","lon":"120.87889","name":"Bulacan","precision":"4","type":"PPLA3"}]}
