<p>Projects shown with end dates in the past are operationally-closed projects that were financially closed in the previous fiscal year. Any transactions shown are accounting entries made to facilitate this change or to reconcile accounts.
</p>

<p>Some projects show negative numbers for expenditures. In these instances, the projects are likely being managed at a different level or are undergoing accounting reconciliation. For instance, in some cases financial management is at the Fund level (such as for Trust Funds) rather than the Project level so adjustments made within a Fund can lead to negative expenditures being displayed.
