The WRSC will be equipped with a state-of-the-art digital database housing all the information and data relating to women in Kuwait and will be disseminated on the internet to ensure its ubiquity for ease of access. The WRSC will also provide a forum for local and regional institutions dealing with women related issues to share resources and seek knowledge and advice through networking and capacity development initiatives provided by the center. It is envisaged that the WRSC through these interventions will play a big role in contributing to achieving the national outcome relating to enhancing and expanding the scope of women's participation in economic activities, political decision-making, and gender equality, in consistency with national plans and the long-term strategic vision to support attainment of MDG3.","output_id":"00079948","output_title":"Establishment of Women's Resea"}],"project_descr":" ","project_id":"00062458","project_title":"Establishment of Women's Research Center","region_id":"RBAS","start":"2011-01-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00062458","lat":"29.36972","lon":"47.97833","name":"Kuwait","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
