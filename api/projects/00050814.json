The project objective is to develop policy-relevant capacities for the implementation of the global environmental conventions, by enhancing connectivity between the research and policy making for global environmental management. To achieve this, the project will target key research and education institutions and develop necessary knowledge base by building on existing in-house capacities and will build upon existing policies and legal frameworks to ensure that the current national efforts for reforming and implementing these frameworks are enabled and strengthened to catalyze the required reforms.   The project is adopting an approach for mainstreaming and capitalizing upon existing national initiatives already engaged in the application of policies and laws through applied research, which will therefore ensure that the continuity of any enforcement measures of policies and laws will be based on nationally tested and demonstrated systems and approaches.","output_id":"00062933","output_title":"Dev Policy Capacity - Env.Conv"}],"project_descr":"Policy-relevant capacities for the implementation of the Global Environment Conventions are developed","project_id":"00050814","project_title":"Developing policy-relevant capacity of Global Env.
