To contribute to this outcome, the project will concentrate its assistance efforts to the Ministry of Regional Development and Infrastructure (MRDI), and selected Regional and Local authorities.  Capacities of the MRDI will be strengthened in policy-making and implementation, as well as coordination and mobilizing of various stakeholders around the reforms. Another critical dimension of the project is establishment of the essentially new mechanism of capacity development of local civil servants- the Training System. The Training System will contribute to the capacity development of the municipal authorities through cultivation of competitive training market, which will be created based on (1) development of 'demand' identification capacities of LSGs, (2) enhancement of 'supply' capacities of training providers and (3) establishment of effective facilitation mechanism, where demand and supply will come into equilibrium. All respective national, regional and local stakeholders will participate actively in the establishment, management and oversight of the system. As a result, LSGs will benefit from a wide range of quality trainings. Finally, the project will pay a particular attention to improvement of the Strategic Planning and budgeting capacities at local level through supporting in design and implementation of the Regional Development Strategies and RDS Action Programmes , Municipal Development Plans and strengthening local capacities to reflect development plans into municipal programme budgets.","output_id":"00080250","output_title":"Regional & Local Developm.
