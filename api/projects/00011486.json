Through the use of long-term technical advice, supplanted by the provision of knowledge and institutional support, the project will use key entry points to enhance the capacity of the Bangladesh Parliament. The entry points will include support to the Parliamentary Parties, Standing Committees, the Office of the Honourable Speaker and the Secretariat. New entry points will be created through the development of a better relationship between Members of Parliament (MPs) and the citizens of Bangladesh and through the use of multi-party issue-based caucuses.","output_id":"00075824","output_title":"Imprv.
