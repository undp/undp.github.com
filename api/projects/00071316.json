This is potentially a 5year initiative that will facilitate an inter-institutional and multi-stakeholder dialogue that will serve to coordinate actions to improve cocoa livelihoods through improving economic opportunities within cocoa supply chain in the Dominican Republic. This program seeks to demonstrate the economic benefits of environmentally sustainable cocoa farming. \r\nThe first phase of the project will be to assess current cocoa production practices and their environmental impact, to identify institutional barriers and policy gaps and identify sustainable financing options. Complementary, the initiative will establish and coordinate a platform with multi-sectorial stakeholders who will facilitate the dialogue to develop and implement a strategy for sustainable cocoa farming, with emphasis on maximizing the economic benefits of environmental management practices. Phase two will be developed following the implementation and review of impacts assessment of phase one, establishing a long term national programme.","output_id":"00084864","output_title":"Cacao Sostenible"}],"project_descr":"Produccion Sostenible de Cacao","project_id":"00071316","project_title":"Cacao Sostenible","region_id":"RBLAC","start":"2012-12-18","subnational":[]}
