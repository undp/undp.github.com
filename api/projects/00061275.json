It will mobilize resources to prepare, plan, and implement interventions to ensure that the people affected by disasters recover and seek development gains.  The ERF will support the national and local government in developing policies and plans for full recovery. Such support will be provided through systematic assessment of recovery needs, coordination amongst various agencies, preparation of an early recovery plan/ framework, and human resource support wherever necessary. The ERF will promote equity, social inclusion, and transparency in promoting recovery policies and plans. It will advocate people's participation in recovery planning, and promote policies and programmes which do not discriminate on the basis of gender, ethnicity, religion, age, disability, etc. The ERF will support and strengthen the Early Recovery Network and Early Recovery Cluster in Bangladesh, develop an overall recovery preparedness plan, and advocate for the allocation of resources in support of early recovery activities.","output_id":"00077582","output_title":"Early Recovery Facility (ERF)"}],"project_descr":"Early Recovery Facility (ERF)","project_id":"00061275","project_title":"Early Recovery Facility (ERF)","region_id":"RBAP","start":"2011-01-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00061275","lat":"24","lon":"90","name":"Bangladesh","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
