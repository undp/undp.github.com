Publishing detailed information about UNDP’s global activities strengthens the organization’s ability to achieve positive development results through better accountability, efficient resource management, and sustainable partnerships.

As a signatory of [IATI](http://www.aidtransparency.net/) and member of its secretariat, UNDP disclosed its first dataset on 2010 development projects and expenditures in compliance with IATI principles. Publish What You Fund’s [Aid Transparency Index](http://www.publishwhatyoufund.org/index/2012-index/) recognized this accomplishment, along with our corporate efforts toward enhancing transparency by ranking UNDP in the top 10 among 58 and 72 donors/organizations respectively in both 2011 and 2012.

UNDP also leads outreach efforts with partner countries and other UN agencies to champion the new aid transparency standard. This has helped to make it more relevant for national development planning, public financial management, mutual accountability, and other processes at the country level. UNDP has been actively involved in [pilot initiatives in several developing countries](http://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IATI-country-paper-overview-final.pdf), including the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, testing the benefits of IATI to support:

- Aid Information Management Systems through automated data exchange
- South-South cooperation information sharing
- Alignment of aid information with budget and medium-term expenditure frameworks

Among its planned innovations to open.undp.org, UNDP will expand real-time updates from the field through Twitter, implement a geocoding feature, and move to automated reporting in 2013.
