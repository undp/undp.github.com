The project will remove systemic, regulatory and knowledge barriers  which will be achieved through two outcomes: i) Enabling policy, legislative, and institutional environment for mainstreaming biodiversity conservation considerations in the oil-and-gas sector, and ii) Demonstrating biodiversity mainstreaming technologies in oil-and-gas operations on the Ustyurt Plateau. The immediate global benefits include mainstreaming of biodiversity into the oil-and-gas sector at project sites having a positive impact on an area more than 2 million hectares. This will ensure population stability of a number of threatened species, including Houbara bustard, Caracal, Goitered gazelle, Ustyurt urial and the Saiga antelope.","output_id":"00076189","output_title":"Biodiversity in Oil/Gas Sector"}],"project_descr":"Mainstreaming biodiversity into Uzbekistan's oil-and-gas sector policies and operations.","project_id":"00060502","project_title":"Biodiversity in Oil and Gas sector","region_id":"RBEC","start":"2010-11-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00060502","lat":"42.45306","lon":"59.61028","name":"Karakalpakstan","precision":"4","type":"PPLA"},{"awardID":"00060502","lat":"41.26465","lon":"69.21627","name":"Tashkent","precision":"1","type":"PPLC"}]}
