Following a request by IUCN, the Project Board approved the movement of $65,000 from vulnerability studies to national strategy development within the IUCN project ($45,000 from 2011 and $20,000 from 2012). As a result, all funds from Activity 6 (for both 2011 and 2012) have now been reallocated to Activity 3, to be implemented in 2011. In addition, $1,000 under Activity 8 (implementation fee) was shifted from 2012 to 2011. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","output_id":"00076267","output_title":"Mainstreaming gender in CCI"}],"project_descr":"Mainstreaming Gender Equality in Climate Change Initiatives and Decision-making at the National, Regional, and International Level","project_id":"00060529","project_title":"Mainstreaming gender in climate change intiatives","region_id":"global","start":"2010-08-01","subnational":[]}
