This integrated programme approach focuses on strengthening Tonga's governance institutions and an improved understanding in the community of the role of parliament; the functions of the electoral commission; and the role civil society organizations play in promoting good governance and supporting an improved understanding of governance concepts in the community. The programme draws together the Parliamentary strengthening project designed by UNDP; the Australian Electoral Commission led support provided to the Tonga Electoral Commission; and proposal to strengthen civil society's relationship with the Tonga Parliament and Government as well an increased role for civil society in providing civic education and enhancing accountability of duty-bearers.
