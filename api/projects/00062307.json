The country has a mature and generalized HIV epidemic, with an adult prevalence (15-49 years) of 14.3% (ZDHS, 2007).  A review of the HIV prevalence trend shows that in adults aged (15-49 years), the prevalence has halved since 1990, with the incidence stabilising at an estimated 1.6% in 2009.   In children aged 0-14years, new infections have declined from the peak at 21,189 in 1996 to 9,196 in 2009.  In 2009, it was estimated that 1 million people in Zambia were living with HIV with 226 new infections (incidence) occurring each day, out of which 25 are among children due to vertical transmission.  Co-infection of TB and HIV is also common, with 70% of TB patients in Zambia also living with HIV (NASF, 2010).\r\n\r\nThe project is supporting Zambia's response to scaling up treatment, care and support for people infected by HIV and affected by AIDS.  In particular the project is enhancing the availability of adults and pediatric ART services through the procurement of ARV drugs, to ensure universal access.  Under the project 68 sites providing ART services are will be renovated and provided with equipment. The project will also support improvement of data management through training of key health workers in electronic data management, and supply of IT equipment.","output_id":"00079743","output_title":"GFATM Round10 HIV Grant-Zambia"}],"project_descr":"Improved access to Antiretroviral Therapy and increased access to HIV counselling and testing services","project_id":"00062307","project_title":"GFATM Round 10 HIV Grant in Zambia","region_id":"RBA","start":"2011-09-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00062307","lat":"-15.40669","lon":"28.28713","name":"Lusaka","precision":"3","type":"PPLC"}]}
