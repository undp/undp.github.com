A regional HDR is a well recognized platform to address the Millennium Development Goals, inequality reduction and, more broadly, promoting human development, making it an excellent instrument for advocacy to influence policies and programmes.  The Project will undertake high-quality analysis followed by advocacy to contribute to better integration of human development concerns into policies.
