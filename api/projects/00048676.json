The processes of environmental degradation in the basin covering all sectors, both in urban and in rural areas. The lack of treatment of domestic sewage and deforestation of recharge areas and river banks for various purposes have been some of the main causes of this degradation.\nInitially, this project constitutes a set of proposals which aim at training activities in services, making use of social technologies, to combat erosion, as a strategy for revitalization of the S\u00e3o Francisco River basin, within the scope of PAC-Revitalization , whose coordination is under the Ministry of Integration.
