The project will also support the development of hydrogen and fuel cell vehicles(FCV) related value chain while enhance scientific, technical, and industrial capacity for commercializing FCBs; and increase the understanding of FCVs and clean vehicles among government, academics, investers, media, and other key actors. Finally, a series of activities will focus on defining a detailed strategy for large-scale FCB commercialization in China. Other capacity building activities will also include expanding government policies, technical standards, enhancing domestic research and development capabilities to support FCB commercialization in China.","output_id":"00051247","output_title":"PIMS 2933: Fuel Cell Bus II"}],"project_descr":"Demonstration for Fuel-cell Bus Commercialization in China (Phase II)","project_id":"00043802","project_title":"PIMS 2933:Demo -Fuel Cell Bus Commercialization Phase II","region_id":"RBAP","start":"2007-01-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00043802","lat":"39.9075","lon":"116.39723","name":"Beijing","precision":"4","type":"ADM1"},{"awardID":"00043802","lat":"31.22222","lon":"121.45806","name":"Shanghai","precision":"4","type":"ADM1"}]}
