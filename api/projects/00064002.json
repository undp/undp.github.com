This gap needs to be bridged at the risk of constantly squandering investments made and of undermining povery alleviation efforts. In addition, national capacity to envision, design, and plan for implementation, through broad inclusive processes, new development paths which lead to a 'greener', low-emission, climate-resillient human development also needs strengthening. \r\n\r\nThe project will help bridge these gaps, having as its chief purpose to support govenrment institutions, civil society organizations, the private sector and diferent target groups to manage more efifciently its natural resources and to develop national capacities for green human development.","output_id":"00080863","output_title":"Green Human Development"}],"project_descr":"Developing National Capacities for Green Human Development","project_id":"00064002","project_title":"Developing National Capacities for Green Human Developme","region_id":"RBA","start":"2012-01-01","subnational":[]}
