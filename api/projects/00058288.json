PRP supports the transition from a colonial style police force to democratic policing by strengthening the Bangladesh Police's ability to contribute to a safer and more secure environment based on respect for the rule of law, human rights and equitable access to justice. The Programme has a specific focus on the poor and disadvantaged, women and children, and delivering tangible results at the Thana (police station) level. PRP also recognises the potential contribution that the police can make to national security and social and economic growth. PRP seeks to strengthen functional linkages with the broader social and justice sector. The Ministry of Home Affairs and Bangladesh Police drive the reform process with technical and financial support from UNDP and other development partners. Phase I of PRP (January 2005-September 2009) established the foundation for reform by building national ownership and supporting the roll out of a community policing philosophy across the country. Phase II will consolidate previous efforts by supporting the Bangladesh Police Strategic Plan and pursuing the following outcomes:\n1.\tStrategic direction and organisational reform;\n2.\tHuman resource management and training;\n3.\tInvestigations, operations and prosecutions;\n4.\tCrime prevention and community policing;\n5.\tPromoting gender sensitive policing; and\n6.\tInformation, communications and technology.","output_id":"00072355","output_title":"Police Reform Programme II"}],"project_descr":"Police Reform Programme Phase II","project_id":"00058288","project_title":"Police Reform Programme Phase II","region_id":"RBAP","start":"2009-10-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00058288","lat":"24","lon":"90","name":"Bangladesh","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
