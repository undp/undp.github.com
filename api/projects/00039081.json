This will be done through a country-driven consultative process,  that takes into account Solomon Islands' obligations under the three global conventions on biodiversity, climate change and desertification/land degradation. The assessment will provide national decision-makers and funding agencies with essential information about Solomon Islands' specific capacity needs to meet its international environmental obligations. The resulting document will identify prioritized national capacity needs, a resources mobilization strategy and a capacity development action plan to guide further actions for the strengthening of national capacity.","output_id":"00043653","output_title":"PIMS 2640 NC EA: NCSA"}],"project_descr":" ","project_id":"00039081","project_title":"PIMS 2640 NC EA: National Capacity Self Assessment","region_id":"RBAP","start":"2005-03-01","subnational":[]}
