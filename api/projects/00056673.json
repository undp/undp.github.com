This project is designed to provide technical support to: a) develop the capacities of the property tax staff of the Ministry of Finance in order to conduct comprehensive property valuation in 108 newly upgraded municipalities to enable property tax collection resulting in increasing assigned revenues for local governments, b) institutionalize an automated system of property tax operations ; c) develop comprehensive analytical assessment reports of own-source revenues; and d) develop a new property tax law that is modern, unifies procedures in the West Bank and Gaza Strip (WB&GS) and meets international standards. The project will be jointly implemented by UNDP/PAPP, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Local Government, Association of Palestinian Local Authorities (APLA), and selected local governments.","output_id":"00073971","output_title":"Support to Fiscal Decentraliza"},{"award_id":"00056673","budget":[0.0,53904.0,229785.0,null],"crs":"15130","crs_descr":"Legal and judicial development","donor_id":["00012"],"donor_name":["Voluntary Contributions"],"donor_short":["UNDP"],"expenditure":[-35.0,51047.0,178217.0,22892.0],"fiscal_year":["2013","2012","2011","2010"],"focus_area":"2","focus_area_descr":"Democratic governance","gender_descr":"Gender Equality","gender_id":"1","output_descr":"This project is part of the UNDP/PAPP Local Governance Support Programme (LGSP 2010-2012) that aims to contribute to the development of a democratic, decentralized, transparent, and inclusive local governance system in the oPt.\r\nThe process of giving local government in the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt) a greater role in economic development is taking place within the context of a reconsideration of the structure and responsibilities of local government. The case for decentralization rests in part on the effective canonization of the economy arising from designation of land categories and travel limitations. Support to economic decentralization will be delivered as one element of UNDP's Local Government Support Programme, which has the objective of decentralized, efficient and inclusive local government in the oPt capable of delivering quality services. The approach to developing an economic role for local government units will initially be through experimentation, focusing on 'pilot' municipalities as a basis for models. Funding will also be provided to support assumption of these responsibilities and directly for actions in economic development.","output_id":"00074700","output_title":"Support to LED in the oPt"}],"project_descr":"This Programme aims at contributing to the development of a democratic, decentralized, transparent and inclusive system of Local Governance in the oPt that is more responsive and capable of delivering quality services to local communities.","project_id":"00056673","project_title":"Local Governance Support Programme","region_id":"PAPP","start":"2009-01-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00056673","lat":"31.5","lon":"34.46667","name":"Gaza","precision":"4","type":"ADM1"},{"awardID":"00056673","lat":"32.22111","lon":"35.25444","name":"West Bank","precision":"4","type":"ADM1"},{"awardID":"00056673","lat":"32.22111","lon":"35.25444","name":"West Bank","precision":"4","type":"ADM1"}]}
