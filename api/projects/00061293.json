The three activities provide quantitative and qualitative information intended to inform social and economic policy in Georgia. The study on social vulnerability aims to identify key barriers to Georgia's human development resulting from people's limited capabilities to actively engage and participate in various spheres of human life. A specific focus is placed on employment, livelihoods and social and civic networks. The study will outline major policy challenges and provide directions for policy interventions.","output_id":"00077610","output_title":"Vulnerability Study"}],"project_descr":"Assessment of  Social Vulnerability in Georgia","project_id":"00061293","project_title":"Assessment of  Social Vulnerability in Georgia","region_id":"RBEC","start":"2011-02-15","subnational":[{"awardID":"00061293","lat":"41.69411","lon":"44.83368","name":"Tbilisi","precision":"3","type":"PPLC"},{"awardID":"00061293","lat":"41.64159","lon":"41.63593","name":"Batumi","precision":"3","type":"PPLA"},{"awardID":"00061293","lat":"41.54949","lon":"44.99323","name":"Rustavi","precision":"3","type":"PPL"},{"awardID":"00061293","lat":"41.44794","lon":"44.53838","name":"Bolnisi","precision":"3","type":"PPL"}]}
