As programmes/projects support transition to National Implementation Modality, the project is expected to improve the overall performance of national institutions particularly in the areas of programme, procurement and financial management and consequently enhance the external assistance for the country's development. This will be achieved through a multi-pronged capacity development approach as detailed in this project document to provide training to bridge capacity gaps as identified in the capacity assessment of the national partners. The project is being implemented in compliment to other ongoing UN Capacity Development Initiatives including the roll-out of the harmonized Approach to cash Transfer to national partners (HACT). It is expected that over time, national institutions would have the capacity to take over increased responsibility for implementing UNDP supported programmes.","output_id":"00084808","output_title":"Support GOL Capacity on Nation"}],"project_descr":"Support Government of Liberia (GOL) Capacity on National Implementation","project_id":"00071183","project_title":"Support GOL Capacity on National Implementation","region_id":"RBA","start":"2013-01-01","subnational":[]}
