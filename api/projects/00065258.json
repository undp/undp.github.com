Set against this backdrop, the country is poised to initiate activities and measures to accelerate the achievement of the MDGs.  Of prime importance in rallying this initiative is the engagement and empowerment of dutybearers and claimholders in pushing for reforms and appropriate interventions that would address bottlenecks in the achievement of the MDGs from the national to sub-national levels.
