Publishing detailed information about UNDP’s global activities strengthens the organization’s ability to achieve positive development results through better accountability, efficient resource management, and sustainable partnerships.

As a signatory of [IATI](http://www.aidtransparency.net/) and member of its secretariat, UNDP disclosed its first dataset on 2010 development projects and expenditures in compliance with IATI principles. Publish What You Fund’s [Aid Transparency Index](http://www.publishwhatyoufund.org/index/2012-index/) recognized this accomplishment, along with our corporate efforts toward enhancing transparency by ranking UNDP in the top 10 among 58 and 72 donors/organizations respectively in both 2011 and 2012.

UNDP also leads outreach efforts with partner countries and other UN agencies to champion the new transparency standard. This has helped to make IATI standard even more relevant for national development planning, public financial management, mutual accountability, and other processes at the country level. UNDP has been actively involved in [pilot initiatives in several developing countries](http://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IATI-country-paper-overview-final.pdf), including the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, testing the benefits of IATI to support:

- Aid Information Management Systems through automated data exchange
- South-South cooperation information sharing
- Alignment of aid information with budget and medium-term expenditure frameworks

In 2013, UNDP started to publish quarterly project-level information, including sub-national geolocation and additional activity-level financial attributes. UNDP reviewed its [Information Disclosure Policy](http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/operations/transparency/information_disclosurepolicy.html) and updated it according to the highest international standards.

###Notes on UNDP work

UNDP partners with people at all levels of society to help build nations that can withstand crisis, and drive and sustain the kind of growth that improves the quality of life for everyone. On the ground in 177 countries and territories, UNDP offers global perspective and local insight to help [empower lives and build resilient nations](http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/ourwork/overview.html).

The operational activities of the UN development system and UNDP are characterized by their universality of presence, impartiality, multi-sectoral approach, and non-conditional grant-based nature.
