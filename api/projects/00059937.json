It will do this by creating enabling regulatory environment, skills and capacity among industry professionals to introduce the principles of integrated building design in Armenian construction practices from the stage of building design through construction to maintenance of the buildings. The support to be provided by the project will combine development of a new regulation (EE building codes and certification scheme) with the training of professionals, demonstration of integrated building design and stimulating manufacturing of new EE materials and equipment.","output_id":"00075196","output_title":"Energy Efficiency in Buildings"}],"project_descr":"Improving Energy Efficiency in Building","project_id":"00059937","project_title":"Improving Energy Efficiency in Building","region_id":"RBEC","start":"2010-06-01","subnational":[]}
