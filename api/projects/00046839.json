The Project objective is to contribute to this goal by providing a field tested protected area management strategy that is adopted for the effective conservation of a representative sample of mangrove ecosystems in Brazil. This will be achieved through four Outcomes: (i) The enabling environment for a sub-system of mangrove ecosystem PA is in place, including policy, regulatory, and financial mechanisms. This will also provide an enabling environment for the implementation, sustainability and replication of the Project strategy (ii) Replicable models are in place for the management of mangrove resources in SNUC sustainable-use protected areas. This will focus on environmental and pro-poor issues through working with communities to improve the sustainability of their livelihoods; (iii) Conservation of mangroves is improved by piloting the alignment of UC management with sectoral and spatial planning through a landscape-based approach. This will tackle barriers to the PA approach from a sectoral perspective; and (iv) Mangrove-related outreach, dissemination and adaptive management will be increased.","output_id":"00055992","output_title":"BRA/07/G32-PIMS 3280-Mangrove"}],"project_descr":"BRA/07/G32 - Mangrove Ecosystems in Brazil","project_id":"00046839","project_title":"BRA/07/G32 - PIMS 3280 - Mangrove Ecosystems in Brazil","region_id":"RBLAC","start":"2008-08-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00046839","lat":"-10","lon":"-55","name":"Brazil","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
