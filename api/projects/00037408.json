In addition to these, three new business incubators were set up in 2010-2011, while four others are in the final development stage and due to launch by Q1 of 2012.\r\n\r\nThe direct beneficiaries of the project are small and medium local start-ups and early-stage businesses. The tenant SMEs join a three-year business incubation programme, whereby they receive support in the form of equipped office spaces, start-up grants and consultancy services. But most importantly, business incubators offer a platform for knowledge exchange, networking and partnership development.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the direct benefits mentioned above, the set up of business incubation centers entails an array of indirect long-term benefits to the local community, including: creation and retention of local business; the creation and encouragement of an entrepreneurial environment within the community; diversification of local economies resulting in meeting the demand for new services; encouragement of entrepreneurship among women and/ or minorities; job creation and improvement of living standards.","output_id":"00072886","output_title":"2009 Business Incubators"}],"project_descr":"The Project \"Establishment and Development of Business Incubators in Romania\" aims to support the entrepreneurial spirit and economic development of the targeted areas, by through the development of the SME sector.","project_id":"00037408","project_title":"Establishment and Dev. of Business Incubators","region_id":"RBEC","start":"2004-11-10","subnational":[{"awardID":"00037408","lat":"45.64861","lon":"25.60613","name":"Brasov, Romania","precision":"3","type":"PPLA"},{"awardID":"00037408","lat":"45.86667","lon":"25.78333","name":"Sfantu Gheorghe","precision":"3","type":"PPLA"},{"awardID":"00037408","lat":"46.06667","lon":"23.58333","name":"Alba Iulia, Romania","precision":"3","type":"PPLA"},{"awardID":"00037408","lat":"43.8","lon":"28.58333","name":"Mangalia, Romania","precision":"3","type":"PPLA2"},{"awardID":"00037408","lat":"46.54245","lon":"24.55747","name":"Targu Mures, Romania","precision":"3","type":"PPLA"},{"awardID":"00037408","lat":"47.8","lon":"22.88333","name":"Satu Mare, Romania","precision":"3","type":"PPLA"},{"awardID":"00037408","lat":"46.55","lon":"23.88333","name":"Campia Turzii, Romania","precision":"3","type":"PPLA2"},{"awardID":"00037408","lat":"47.96772","lon":"26.41685","name":"Dorohoi, Romania","precision":"3","type":"ADM2"}]}
