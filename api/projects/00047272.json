Twenty years later, it is important to continue the process of building and maintaining peace by revisiting and reevaluating the Accords with an eye to what has been accomplished, what needs improvement, and what  pressing issues wree not covered by the agreement. This project will accomplish these goals by engaging in research to identify important issues, the current state of the region and a pending agenda; by hosting anniversary celebrations at the United Nations and in Central America to present findings, promote dialogue and call attention to the needs of the region; and by facilitating continued observation of the designated themes.","output_id":"00056634","output_title":"Revisiting Esquipulas II."}],"project_descr":"Revisiting Esquipulas II: The Pending Agenda Evaluation, Celebration and Continued Observation.","project_id":"00047272","project_title":"Revisiting Esquipulas II: The Pending Agenda Evaluation","region_id":"RBLAC","start":"2007-01-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00047272","lat":"10","lon":"-84","name":"Costa Rica","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
